## 🐑 Step 1: Summon the Llama

First things first, let's bring the Llama to your digital pasture! You have two magical incantations to choose from:

### 🧙‍♂️ The Quick Spell (PyPI)

```bash
pip install llama-assistant
pip install pyaudio
```

### 🧙‍♀️ The Enchanter's Way (Source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vietanhdev/llama-assistant.git
cd llama-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyaudio
```

## 🍎 Step 2: Apple Silicon Turbo Boost (Optional)

Got a fancy Apple Silicon machine? Let's give it some extra oomph!

1. 🛠️ Summon the Xcode spirits:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. 🔥 Ignite the METAL flames:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall llama-cpp-python -y
   CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_METAL=on" pip install -U llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir
   ```

## 🎬 Step 3: Lights, Camera, Action!

Time to unleash the Llama:

```bash
llama-assistant
```

Or if you're feeling extra pythonic:

```bash
python -m llama_assistant.main
```

## 🎩 Step 4: The Magic Trick

Voila! Your Llama Assistant is now ready to dazzle. Use the secret handshake (Cmd+Shift+Space on macOS) to summon it anytime, anywhere!

Use **Menu** > **Settings** to customize your Llama's appearance and behavior. 🦙🎩
